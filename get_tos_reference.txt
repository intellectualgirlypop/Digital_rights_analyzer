 'getting terms of service'

Below is an organized list of explanations for every library,
function,and relevant elements used in the analyzer. 

--Key--
L = library(External or built-in package used)
F = function (A block of code that performs a specific task )
   ff = function inner blocks 
C = class (Object blueprint)


Libraries
L1.
-used to quickly send HTTP requests
-allows web material ( Terms of service in this case ) to be retrieved
by software 
-useful for interacting with APIs and websites

L2.
-takes information out of HTML files
-perfect for activities involving web scraping
-enables Python to browse raw HTML as a tag-base structure by parsing it

L3.
-enables the creation of complete URLs from a base URL and relative path 
using the urljoin function 
-gurantees that "/terms" URLs are transformed into full links


Functions 
F1. 
-attempts to find the website's terms of service page
- yields the first valid path that contains the word "terms" after trying a set of known common paths 
   >ff1.1
   - creates a testable terms of service  URL by joining the main URL with a known path
   -enables the combined URL to receive a request
   -The link is returned if the response is acceptable and contains "terms" in the text content
   -moves on to the following URL in order to gracefully handle failures
F2.
-produces clear, legible text from a page's HTML content after downloading it
-specifically made to function with ToS pages
   >ff2.1
   -parses the HTML output
   -extracts paragraph(<p>)and list (<li>) item tagged elements 
   -transforms the captured HTML into plain text to clean it up
   -combines all of the components into a single string and uses.strip() to remove any whitespace
