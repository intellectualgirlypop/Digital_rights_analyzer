 'risk level'

Below is an organized list of explanations for every library,
function,and relevant elements used in the analyzer. 

--Key--
L = library(External or built-in package used)
F = function (A block of code that performs a specific task )
   ff = function inner blocks 
C = class (Object blueprint)

Libraries 
L1.
-module for regular expression
-used to look for particular keywords that indicate danger in the text
-robust pattern discovery is made possible by case-insensitive matching

Functions 
F1.
-evaluates and assigns a digital risk assessment to the specified language 
from a Terms of Service document:
            High Risk 
            Caution
            Fair Terms
- Scans for predefined red and yellow flags 
    >ff1.1
    -lists phrases that may indicate serious legal or data-related risks
    >ff1.2
    -lists phrases that may indicate uncertain language or possible data collection
    signaling caution
    >ff1.3
    -a scoring system that determines the final digital rights warning 
    (these flags are case-insensitive because of're.IGNORECASE')
