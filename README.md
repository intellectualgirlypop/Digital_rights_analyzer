# Digital_rights_analyzer
Takes in the URL of an application or website, and spits out an easy-to-comprehend summary of their terms of service in user-friendly terms. It will also give back a traffic light response on its safety.

Part 1 (Planning):
- I want to highlight major data protection laws like GDPR ( a European Union law that sets strict rules for how organizations can use personal data of EU citizens, regardless of the organization's location. It's considered the world's most stringent privacy and security law.)And how it compares to
US regulations.

## Project Goals 
⭐ Accepts a URL
⭐ Retrieves and parses the Terms of Service 
⭐ Summarizes key clauses in plain language 
⭐ Provides traffic light rating (Green = safe, Yellow = Caution. Red = Risky) based on user rights and privacy indicators

## Core Components 
🐸 URL input & terms of service retrieval 
🐸 Text processing & chunking 
🐸 Plain language summarizer 
🐸 Traffic light rating system
