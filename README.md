# Digital_rights_analyzer
Takes in the URL of an application or website, and spits out an easy-to-comprehend summary of their terms of service in user-friendly terms. It will also give back a traffic light response on its safety.


## Project Goals 
⭐ Accepts a URL
⭐ Retrieves and parses the Terms of Service 
⭐ Summarizes key clauses in plain language 
⭐ Provides traffic light rating (Green = safe, Yellow = Caution. Red = Risky) based on user rights and privacy indicators

## Core Components 
🐸 URL input & terms of service retrieval 
🐸 Text processing & chunking 
🐸 Plain language summarizer 
🐸 Traffic light rating system 

## Things I Learned 
🦋 How to obtain, authorize, and utilize an API Key 
🦋 How NOT to push projects that utilize an API key ( uploading such a secret will horrifically mess up your tree) DO NOT DO IT 
🦋Revised Python libraries 
🦋Revised Git commands 
🦋How difficult parsing and patching are ( made analyzer more user-friendly as well)
🦋The varying troublesome privacy policies/user-agreements published on the web
